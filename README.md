# OCaml Toy

This repository contains a basic interpreter suitable as a starting point for a toy language.

It is derived from the Cornell University (I think) CS3110 lab described [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2015fa/l/12-interp/rec.html)
but has been heavily modified with inspiration from "Essentials of Programming Languages" by Friedman and Wand.  The
example code from the book can be found [here](https://github.com/mwand/eopl3).

The original files can be downloaded [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2015fa/l/12-interp/rec-code.zip).

Prerequisites:

- `opam init`
- `opam setup -a`
- `opam install menhir`
- `opam install linenoise`
- `opam install ounit`
- `opam install unix`
- `opam install dune`

To build, run `dune build` from the project's root directory.  To build and test, run `dune runtest`.

I also recommend:

- `opam install merlin utop ocp-indent tuareg`

## Features

- Supported data types:
  - int
  - bool
  - functions
- Variables
- Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Closures
- Function calls
- A REPL

## Examples

```
TODO (for now, see test/tests.ml)
```

## TODO

- Add support for functions with multiple arguments
- Add the language features of your choice.

Tested with `ocamlc` 4.07.1.

## Working With Menhir 

If, after modifying `parser.mly` a message appears about shift/reduce conflicts, it can be hard to diagnose
what's going on.  To get `menhir` to tell you about the shift/reduce conflicts, execute

```
menhir --explain lib/parser.mly
``

Then, you can examine the file `lib/parser.conflicts` to read about the first shift/reduce conflict detected.
