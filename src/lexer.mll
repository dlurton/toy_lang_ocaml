(* The first section of the lexer definition, called the *header*,
   is the part that appears below between { and }.  It is code
   that will simply be copied literally into the generated lexer.ml. *)

The ocamllex bootstrapped lexer seems like a good thing to use an
example for error handling: https://github.com/let-def/ocamllex/blob/master/lexer.mll
*)

let raise_lexical_error lexbuf msg =
  let p = Lexing.lexeme_start_p lexbuf in
  let src_loc = make_source_location p.Lexing.pos_fname p.Lexing.pos_lnum p.Lexing.pos_cnum in
  raise (LexicalExn (src_loc, msg))
  (*raise (LexicalExn src_loc msg) *)

}

(* The second section of the lexer definition defines *identifiers*
   that will be used later in the definition.  Each identifier is
   a *regular expression*.  We won't go into details on how regular
   expressions work.
   
   Below, we define regular expressions for 
     - whitespace (spaces and tabs),
     - digits (0 through 9)
     - integers (nonempty sequences of digits, optionally preceded by a minus sign)
     - letters (a through z, and A through Z), and
     - identifiers (nonempty sequences of letters).
     
   FYI, these aren't exactly the same as the OCaml definitions of integers and 
   identifiers. *)

let white = [' ' '\t']+
let digit = ['0'-'9']
let int = '-'? digit+
let letter = ['a'-'z' 'A'-'Z']
let id = letter+

(* The final section of the lexer definition defines how to parse a character
   stream into a token stream.  Each of the rules below has the form 
     | regexp { action }
   If the lexer sees the regular expression [regexp], it produces the token 
   specified by the [action].  We won't go into details on how the actions
   work.  *)

rule read =
  parse
  | white { read lexbuf }
  | "+"   { PLUS }
  | "("   { LPAREN }
  | ")"   { RPAREN }
  | "let" { LET }
  | "="   { EQUALS }
  | "in"  { IN }
  | id    { ID (Lexing.lexeme lexbuf) }
  | int   { INT (int_of_string (Lexing.lexeme lexbuf)) }
  | eof   { EOF }
  | _ {
      let illegal_c = Lexing.lexeme lexbuf in
      raise_lexical_error lexbuf ("Illegal character: " ^ illegal_c)
    }

(* And that's the end of the lexer definition. *)
